## Notes for work

- Leave notes regarding what I learn
- Look back on myself regularly and check my ability in terms of `project experience`, `co-working`, `knowledge`



## Long-Term Goal

- Write `paper` of which topic is related to `Deep-Learning`
- Share `NLP project` on Github, which is referenced by Deep-Learning programmers
